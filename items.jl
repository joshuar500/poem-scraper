There was a contention as far as a suit (in ", "     which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were ", "     mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers ", "     first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring ", "     first that rose earliest.  If we understand aright the dignity of ", "     this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to ", "     make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be ", "     ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.  The bell doth toll for him ", "     that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that ", "     minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. ", "     Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes ", "     off his eye from a comet when that breaks out?  Who bends not his ", "     ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove ", "     it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this ", "     world?  No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece ", "     of the continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by ", "     the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as ", "     well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's ", "     death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and ", "     therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for ", "     thee.  Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing ", "     of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but ", "     must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the ", "     misery of our neighbours.  Truly it were an excusable covetousness ", "     if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath ", "     enough of it.  No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and ", "     ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.

Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not ", "     current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our ", "     home, heaven, by it.  Another man may be sick too, and sick to ", "     death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a ", "     mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his ", "     affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this ", "     consideration of another's danger I take mine own into ", "     contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my ", "     God, who is our only security. \r\n                        ", "\r\n                    "], "author": ["John Donne"], "title": ["For Whom The Bell Tolls"]}
